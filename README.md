My birthday card gift with flipping effect and a bounce from top animation effect. 
#### Deployed using Mac os and realized that you must use a personalized access token inorder to push the code, here's the procedure:-
1. Go to your GitHub settings, select "Developer settings", then "Personal access tokens". Click "Generate new token" and give it the required permissions.
2. Copy the generated token.
3. Return to the terminal and push the existing files, instead of using your password, use the personal access token as your password.
